This Tutorial is based on: "Reduced Basis Methods for Partial Differential Equations - An Introduction".

It is a summary and guide to what was learned and programmed in the Independent Studies, Spring 24.
The Book "Reduced Basis Methods for Partial Differential Equations - An Introduction" was used as a basis and was read until chapter 7. We start off with an introduction to FEniCSx. Then we programmed the "Mixer Problem" of the book, introduced in Chapter 3, and performed some simple parameter investigation. Based on that we will also introduce a simple version of the Greedy Algorithm. 

Main ToDo: 
1. Some refinements and corrections in the already existing code.
2. Further investigations of the parameters and especially Greedy Algorithm.
3. Implementing Time Dependent Problems.
4. Investigating Parallel Processing.
5. Extraction ROM out of Parameter Investigation. 
6. Finishing up the Book "RBM for PDE".
